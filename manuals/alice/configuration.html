                </b> Left-click any of the four numbered areas to expose further
                options for fine-tuning your system and your game play.<br>
                <br>
                <b>1. Video</b>  – From here you can adjust the way your
                computer displays the game. Your system has detected Screen
                Resolution and Color Depth. You may change those settings if you
                wish. You can also use the available sliders to control the
                following:
                <blockquote>
                <p><b>Brightness</b> changes how light or dark your video
                appears, similar to brightness on your monitor.</p>
                <p><b>Texture Detail</b> is used to control the size of the
                textures being displayed in the game, smaller textures look less
                detailed because they have to be stretched to cover the space
                they fill, but the game operates faster with less detail.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>These adjustments might make Alice run more efficiently on
                your system.<br>
                <br>
                <b>2. Audio </b> – From here you can select a sound driver,
                adjust music and sound effects volume, and choose your speaker
                type and sound quality. Force 8-bit will uses 8-bit sampled
                sound instead of 16-bit sound. By doing this there is less sound
                data, which takes up less memory and thus helps increase the
                speed in which your game operates.<br>
                <br>
                <b>3. Controls </b>– Use this menu to fine-tune your control
                of the Alice character and the Game environment. The Control
                options are detailed under <b>PLAYING THE GAME</b>, below.&nbsp;<br>
                <br>
                To change an option, left-click on it to select it, and then
                left-click the column to the right of that option. You’ll be
                prompted to Press Any Key. Press the key that you wish to
                designate as the control key for this game-play function.<br>
                <br>
                If you have changed any control options on this menu, click the
                <b>Apply</b> button to accept and save the changes or click the <b>Cancel</b>
                button to return to the Setting Menu.<br>
                <br>
                <b>4. Game Options</b>  – Customize these options to reflect
                your own taste and play style.</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p><b>Invert Mouse </b>reverses the direction the camera looks when you move the mouse

                  <p><b>Always Run</b> lets you Run at ALL times. The default setting is

                  <p><b>Jump Reticle</b> helps you judge distance, and gauge your potential to make a jump successfully. See <b>PLAYING THE GAME</b>, below for more about Jumping.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p><b>Target Reticle</b> helps you home in on your enemies.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p><b>Console</b> The console can be evoked allowing the player to enter advanced commands and settings into the game, and should not be used unless necessary.</p>

                <p><b>PLAYING THE GAME<br>
                </b>Alice’s movements are controlled with a keyboard and the
                mouse. To see the control keys, choose 3 from the <b>Settings Menu</b>.
                On the Controls Menu move the slider and expose all the keys.
                The movements and their corresponding [<b>default controls</b>] are:</p>

                <br>
                <b>Alternate Attack</b>  – Right-click [<b>Mouse 2</b>] to execute a

                <br>
                <b>Move Forward  – [W]</b> moves Alice forward or advances her.<br>

                <b>Move Backward  – [S]</b> moves her backward or retreats.<br>

                <b>Use Item – [Enter]</b> opens doors, activates levers, climbs up vines, etc.</p>

                There are plenty of challenging obstacles in Wonderland and jumping
                is a control movement you’ll need to master. Let’s say you’re
                at an impasse or a crevasse, and you need to jump:</p>
                Face the area where you want to land. Move the mouse slightly
                forward and back. The Jump Reticle--a pair of brightly lit shoe
                soles (size 6)--will display to help you with your jump. Move
                the mouse until you feel comfortable with the landing area (for
                example dry land, as opposed to lava).&nbsp; Press the <b>Spacebar</b>.
                Practice makes perfect.
                <p><img border="0" src="images/control_climb.jpg" align="right" hspace="20" width="225" height="182"><b>Climbing</b><br>
                If an area looks as though she can reach it with a jump, try it.
                If she falls just short, Alice will grab onto and hang from
                walls, ledges, bluffs and such. If an object is blocking her
                ascent, press the strafe keys to move Alice to a clear spot Now,
                don’t leave her dangling. After she grabs on, press <b>W</b> and
                Alice will pull herself up.<br>
                <br>
                To let go without climbing up, press <b>F</b>.<br clear="all">
                <br>
                <b><img border="0" src="images/control_vine.jpg" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="5" width="225" height="181"></b><b>Vine / Swinging</b><br>
                Vines and ropes are invaluable---if you know how to use them.
                Face the vine and then use the Jump key [<b>Spacebar</b>] to jump out
                toward the vine. Release the Jump key when she’s close to it
                and Alice will grab on.<br>
                <br>
                Use the Move Forward [<b>W</b>] and Move Backward [<b>S</b>] keys to swing.
                When you feel Alice has sufficient momentum to complete a vine
                jump, press the Jump key [Spacebar] and Alice will release the
                vine. Her momentum will carry her hopefully to a safe landing.<br>
                <br>
                <b><img border="0" src="images/control_swim.jpg" align="right" hspace="20" vspace="2" width="225" height="177"></b><b>Swimming</b><br>
                Swimming in Alice is easy; just dive in. Once Alice is
                completely submerged use the Move Forward key [<b>W</b>] in combination
                with the Swim Up [<b>Spacebar</b>] or the Swim Down [<b>F</b>] to navigate
                underwater. A note of caution: If you hear Alice coughing while
                swimming, it means she’s running low on air. Alice is strong
                and brave, but even she needs to surface periodically.<br>
                <br>
                <b>CAT SUMMONING BUTTON [HELP]</b><br>
                <br>
                The Cheshire Cat is a friend, although his words can sometimes
                be enigmatic. Press [<b>C</b>] when you need help. Your tattooed ally
                may have something useful to say.</p>
