<BR/><b>X.</b> Wherever possible, the translation of Remember11 that this patch contains has been localized sufficiently to prevent breaks in flow of the text while still delivering a translation in the same spirit of the original. We also decided against including excessive TL notes, either in-game out, as it's our philosophy that in most cases, a good translation shouldn't require them anyway. This readme is therefore sort of a bonus, and serves to explain the few items that were either confusing no matter how we translated them, or more interesting with background knowledge. They're divided by character chapter and day, and contain no spoilers, so read them, if you should choose to, with impunity.
<BR/>
<BR/>Thanks to N.H. for several major contributions, and to Krdskrm for helping me round them all up for this readme.

<BR/>
<BR/><font size="+2">==I. Prologue==</font>
<BR/>
<BR/><b>Yuni: My friends often tease me by calling me "Yunishiro" or "Unit Bath," though.</b>
<BR/>Yunishiro is apparently a clothing company that was popular in the late 90s. Unit baths, a bathtub and shower (sometimes including a toilet and sink as well) molded out of a single big piece of plastic for easier cleaning, are a common fixture in modern Japanese apartments. See <a href="http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/la/at-asia/at-asia-yunitto-basu-or-the-unit-bath-035316">this link.</a>
<BR/>
<BR/>
<BR/><font size="+2">==II. Kokoro==</font>
<BR/>
<BR/><font size="+1">Day 1:</font>
<BR/>
<BR/><b>Yuni: Look, you've got crows' feet all around your eyes, don't you? Tobilin-chan～</b>
<BR/>Crows' feet are the patterns of wrinkles that form around the eye with age. Yuni got her good with that one, since he combined a bird reference with a dig about her being old.
<BR/>
<BR/><font size="+1">Day 2:</font>
<BR/>
<BR/><b>Kokoro: Umm, let's see.... according to "Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morality," Kant wrote, "Two things fill the mind with ever-increasing awe..."</b>
<BR/>The full quote Kokoro references goes thus:
<BR/>"Two things fill the mind with ever-increasing wonder and awe, the more often and the more intensely the mind of thought is drawn to them: the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me."
<BR/>
<BR/><b>Salutations?
<BR/>Please forgive the lateness of my reply?
<BR/>I hope this letter finds you well?</b>
<BR/>All of these are formal expressions used in letter-writing; zenryaku (前略), sousou (草々), and 本日はお日柄もよく (honnichi wa ohigaru mo yoku) respectively. They were replaced with rough English equivalents.
<BR/>
<BR/><b>Was this, too, just me getting spooked by shadows?</b>
<BR/>What Kokoro said here references the phrase "yuurei no shoutai mitari kareobana" (幽霊の正体見たり枯れ尾花), literally "the ghost, when you examine it closely, is only withered silver grass" - a figure of speech meaning something frightening that is actually ordinary once you look closer.
<BR/>
<BR/><b>Sekijukansei</b>
<BR/>The actual "saying" is a play on the kanji used in the phrase. In Japanese, adding the radical for heart/Kokoro, 心, makes the four characters 恋愛感情, which roughly translated means "love and emotion." Satoru explains the subtle meaning at the end of Day 7 in his route.
<BR/>
<BR/><font size="+1">Day 5:</font>
<BR/>
<BR/><b>She had no trust in us whatsoever, and regarded everything she saw as suspicious.</b>
<BR/>Kokoro uses the proverb "gishin anki" (疑心暗鬼), literally "suspicion raises demons," meaning that once you suspect one person of something, you begin to see suspicious goings-on everywhere. See Higurashi for another use of this term.
<BR/>
<BR/>
<BR/><font size="+2">==III. Satoru==</font>
<BR/>
<BR/><font size="+1">Day 2:</font>
<BR/>
<BR/><b>My body was as heavy as stone.</b>
<BR/>Satoru specifically said it was as heavy as a tsukemono-ishi (漬け物石), a large stone or weight used in traditional pickle-making which can weigh in excess of two kilograms (4.4 pounds).
<BR/>
<BR/><b>Mayuzumi: Article 246 of the penal code: A person who defrauds another of property shall be punished by imprisonment with work not more than ten years.</b>
<BR/>This and other Mayuzumi quotes regarding the Japanese constitution and various laws came from the <a href="http://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/law/detail/?ft=3&amp;re=02&amp;dn=1&amp;x=91&amp;y=16&amp;bu=16&amp;ky=&amp;page=6">Japanese Law Translation site.</a>
<BR/>
<BR/><font size="+1">Day 3:</font>
<BR/>
<BR/><b>Utsumi: Hey youse! Where da heck you think yer goin'?</b>
<BR/>Utsumi's line in the original was "Doko sa iku sa! Omee sa!" which is an extremely provincial, slangy way that one could say "Hey you, where are you going?" She then trys to cover by claiming she actually said (the Japanese pronounciation of) docosahexaenoic acid, or DHA, which is an omega-3 fatty acid found in fish oil.
<BR/>
<BR/><b>Yuni selected an overhand shot.</b>
<BR/>In the original text, this was the rather confusing "onnanoko-nage" (女の子投げ) or "girl throw," which does indeed refer to an overhanded shot. Shooting underhand, considered more difficult, is 女の子投げでない "onnanoko-nage dewa nai."
<BR/>
<BR/><b>about 7.76 acres</b>
<BR/>Originally 9,503 tsubo, tsubo being an old Japanese unit of measurement. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_units_of_measurement#Area">this Wikipedia article.</a>
<BR/>
<BR/><b>Paradise Park dome</b>
<BR/>Apparently refers to a park in Izu.
<BR/>
<BR/><font size="+1">Day 4:</font>
<BR/>
<BR/><b>but even if I escaped to Cydonia on the planet Mars, there's still no guarantee that the transfers would stop.</b>
<BR/>Cydonia, rendered 火星の人面岩 in Japanese, refers to a specific hill-like structure on Mars resembling a human face. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cydonia_(region_of_Mars)">this Wikipedia article.</a>
<BR/>
<BR/><font size="+1">Day 5:</font>
<BR/>
<BR/><b>Hotori: The way I see it, what you're writing is just "an exchange diary with yourself."</b>
<BR/>Exchange diaries are commonly kept by junior high or high school students in Japan. The exchange is between two (sometimes more) people; when the first participant finishes writing in the diary, they pass it to the next, who replies before passing it back, and so on.
<BR/>
<BR/><b>Hotori: I've picked up a couple of clues.</b>
<BR/>The word for "clue" Hotori uses here is "kokoroatari" (心当たり), a play on words meant to imply that she suspects Kokoro.
<BR/>
<BR/><font size="+1">Day 7:</font>
<BR/>
<BR/><b>Yomogi: Being Yomogi Seiji, it's only natural to be capable of resurrec...</b>
<BR/>The pun here is that "yomi" is both one of the readings for 黄泉 (part of Yomogi's name; the word itself can be understood to mean "hell" or "underworld") and the beginning of the word "yomigae" ("resurrection").
<BR/>
<BR/>
<BR/><font size="+2">==IV. TIPS==</font>
<BR/>
<BR/>Just for reference's sake, the following Tips have additions or corrections (to factual errors) which were inserted by the project staff:
<BR/><b>Personal Space
<BR/>Solar Wind
<BR/>Phrenology
<BR/>DSM-IV
<BR/>Borderline Personality Disorder*
<BR/>Colloid
<BR/>The Cat Locked in the Box
<BR/>EPR Paper
<BR/>Particle Pair Generation</b>
<BR/>
<BR/>*A lot of this entry, especially the list of criteria, was directly copied from the English DSM-IV-TR; thus, there may be sections which are not 100% direct translations. Notable exceptions are noted below:
<BR/>
<BR/>- The list of aliases for borderline in Japanese were all slightly different writings of the same word. I localized these and substituted some other names which the disorder has gone by.
<BR/>- In the list of symptoms, several items vary from the actual 9-item checklist in the DSMV-IV-TR, namely:
<BR/>	#1 (not an actual listed symptom; the actual #1 is "[f]rantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment.")
<BR/>	#4 (also not an actual symptom; real #4 is "[i]mpulsivity in at least two areas that are potentially self-damaging", which comprises the sublist)
<BR/>	#10 (doesn't exist; there are only 9 criteria. The listed #10 is the real checklist's #4) 
<BR/>
<BR/>Also note that in this entry, "heart" was written in katakana rather than the usual kana or kanji, which means it's likely significant to Kokoro's name somehow.
