<BR/>Yuni: Captain! Captain Yomogi!
<BR/>
<BR/>Yomogi: What's wrong, Private Yuni?!
<BR/>
<BR/>Yuni: We have recovered an awesome treasure!
<BR/>
<BR/>Yomogi: Whaaat?! Treasure?!
<BR/>
<BR/>Yuni: Yes sir! It's this, sir!
<BR/>
<BR/>Yomogi: Oho, if it isn't the game "Remember11"!
<BR/>
<BR/>Yuni: Captain Yomogi, let's try and play it at once!
<BR/>
<BR/>Yomogi: Wait, Private Yuni... There may be traps within this game disc!
<BR/>
<BR/>Yuni: Traps... sir?
<BR/>
<BR/>Yomogi: Yes, that's right. Or, since this is a piece of game software, I fear that the CD player won't be able to play it!
<BR/>
<BR/>Yuni: But, Captain! I wish to try! I must see for myself if there's anything recorded on this disc!
<BR/>
<BR/>Yomogi: Hmmmmmmmmh...
<BR/>
<BR/>Yuni: And even if there are traps, I'll gladly sacrifice myself! So...
<BR/>
<BR/>Yomogi: Wait, Private Yuni! Don't be rash!
<BR/>
<BR/><a name="LV1-1">Yuni: Bakaaan, cashaaan, shakonnn... it went "click", yo...<a href="#LV1">(*1)</a></a>
<BR/>
<BR/>* * *
<BR/>
<BR/>Yuni: Caaaptain! Captain Yomogiiii!
<BR/>
<BR/>Yomogi: What's wrong, Private Yuni?!
<BR/>
<BR/>Yuni: We have recovered an aaaaaawesome treasure!
<BR/>
<BR/>Yomogi: What?! Panties, you say?!
<BR/>
<BR/>Yuni: Non non. Not panties, which you love so dearly, Captain. It's this!
<BR/>
<BR/>Yomogi: Oho, isn't this the soccer game "Remember11"? "Those fervent eleven, who never wavered in their struggle towards the Nationals, must now face..." ...or however it went, right?
<BR/>
<BR/>Yuni: Completely wrong! ...Oh well. Anyway, Captain, let's try playing it at once――
<BR/>
<BR/><a name="LV1-2">Yomogi: Wait, Private Yuni! There may be ropes<a href="#LV1">(*2)</a> within this game disc!</a>
<BR/>
<BR/>Yuni: ...Ropes... sir?
<BR/>
<BR/>Yomogi: Yeah, that's right. There's all kinds of ways to tie something up with ropes, you know? For example, like the pattern on the shell of a tortoise――
<BR/>
<BR/>Yuni: Have you finally gone senile, you old fart? ...Ummmm, well then, never mind the captain, let's...
<BR/>
<BR/>Yomogi: Wait! Don't be hasty, Private Yuni!
<BR/>
<BR/>Yuni: Bakaaan! Cashaaan! Shakooonnn! ...it went "click", yo...
<BR/>
<BR/>* * *
<BR/>
<BR/>Yuni: Captaaaaaain! Captain Yomoooooogi!
<BR/>
<BR/>Yomogi: What on earth's the matter, Private Yuni!?
<BR/>
<BR/>Yuni: We have recoveeeeeeeeered an aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaweeeeeeeeesooooooooommmme treasure!
<BR/>
<BR/>Yomogi: What?! An opossum, you say?!
<BR/>
<BR/>Yuni: Non non. Not the opossum that's sitting on your shoulder right now, Captain. It's this!
<BR/>
<BR/>Yomogi: Ohooooh, if it isn't "Remember11"――
<BR/>
<BR/>Yuni: Yes, the game. Let's play it at once!
<BR/>
<BR/>Yomogi: Wait, Yuni-tan! There may be holes within this game disc!
<BR/>
<BR/>Yuni: Holes... sir? Well, there certainly is one, but...
<BR/>
<BR/>Yomogi: There are many uses for a hole like that, you know? For example, putting it on a tortoise's head and then like wooshswooshwoosh! Spinning it like crazy.
<BR/>
<BR/>Yomogi: LA LA LA LA, I'm not listening anymore, not listening...! Never mind our idiot captain, let's just...
<BR/>
<BR/><a name="LV1-3">Yomogi: Weight!<a href="#LV1">(*3)</a> Yuni-tan! Polyurethane! Polyurethane!<a href="#LV1">(*4)</a></a>
<BR/>
<BR/>Yuni: Bakaaan! ...cashan! Shakooonnnnnn! ...IT WENT "CLICK", YO!
<BR/>
<BR/>* * *
<BR/>
<BR/>Yuni: Captaaaaaain! Captain Yooooomooooooooooooogiiii!
<BR/>
<BR/><a name="LV1-4">Yomogi: ¿Que pasa, Don Yuni?<a href="#LV1">(*5)</a></a>
<BR/>
<BR/>Yuni: We found an awesome, astounding ultra cool, super rare item! Which is of course neither panties nor an opossum.
<BR/>
<BR/>Yomogi: What?! Semi-nude photos of Mayuzumi, you say?! I don't want to see them! I don't want to see them! I REALLY don't want to see them! In fact, I'm going limp just thinking about it...
<BR/>
<BR/>Mayuzumi: Eh?! Did you say something just now?!
<BR/>
<BR/>Yuni: Now now, calm down, Pathfinder Mayuzumi. More importantly――TADAAAAAH! It's this!
<BR/>
<BR/>Yomogi: Ohhohh, isn't this the CD released by the famous new marimba band that everyone's talking about, "Marimba11"?!
<BR/>
<BR/>Yuni: Wrong! ...But really, who even cares at this point?
<BR/>
<BR/>Yuni: Anyway, let's try and play it!
<BR/>
<BR/>Yomogi: Espera, Don Yuni! Here arriba, there arriba! There may be two chickens within this disc!
<BR/>
<BR/>Yuni: Chickens... sir?
<BR/>
<BR/>Yomogi: Yeah, there are many kinds, you know? Like domestic fowl, or poultry...?
<BR/>
<BR/>Yuni: ............They're exactly the same... Let's forget about this idiot and...
<BR/>
<BR/><a name="LV1-5">Yomogi: Alto! Don Yuni! Wicki-wicki-waah, wicki-wicki-WUT!<a href="#LV1">(*6)</a></a>
<BR/>
<BR/>Yuni: Bakaan! Cashaaan! Shakonnn! ...it went "click", yo...

<BR/>
<BR/>おしまい
<BR/>The End.

<BR/>
<BR/><a name="LV2-1">Yomogi: Not bad! You're going fairly steady, I see. But you know, you've only arrived at Rokugome<a href="#LV2">*</a>, I'd say. The summit is still a long way off!</a>
<BR/>
<BR/>
<hr/>
<BR/><font size="+1">Lv3: Message from Mayuzumi</font>
<BR/>
<BR/>Mayuzumi: Well, this level of effort is about what you'd normally expect. Come on, try a little harder now.
<BR/>
<BR/>
<hr/>
<BR/><font size="+1">Lv4: Message from Yuni・No.1</font>
<BR/>
<BR/>Yuni: Awesome... You're awesome! I'm really surprised you've came this far! I'm kinda starting to respect you!
<BR/>
<BR/>
<hr/>
<BR/><font size="+1">Lv5: Message from Utsumi</font>
<BR/>
<BR/>Utsumi: Good job. I didn't think you'd be able to come so far! Don't give up and keep on doing your best from here on out!
<BR/>
<BR/>
<hr/>
<BR/><font size="+1">Lv6: Message from Hotori</font>
<BR/>
<BR/>Hotori: Hmmm, you're not too bad at this, are you? Wonder what you'd prefer as a reward...?
<BR/>
<BR/>
<hr/>
<BR/><font size="+1">Lv7: Message from Yuni・No.2</font>
<BR/>
<BR/>Yuni: At last, you've made it here. However... the true challenge is only just beginning.
<BR/>
<BR/>
<hr/>
<BR/><font size="+1">Lv8: Message from Kokoro</font>
<BR/>
<BR/>Kokoro: Du-dudu-duuun! Just a little bit more and you'll clear the whole thing! Hang in there~!
<BR/>
<BR/>
<hr/>
<BR/><font size="+1">Lv9: Message from Satoru</font>
<BR/>
<BR/>Satoru: The truth is right in front of you. Push forward and don't stop until you can confirm it with your own eyes!
<BR/>
<BR/>
<hr/>
<BR/><font size="+1">Lv∞: Message from Everyone</font>
<BR/>
<BR/>Yomogi: Ooh, so you've finally conquered it!
<BR/>
<BR/>Mayuzumi: Hmmm... not too bad at all.
<BR/>
<BR/>Yuni: Wahahaa! Super awesome!
<BR/>
<BR/>Utsumi: Indeed! You have my admiration.
<BR/>
<BR/>Hotori: I'd anticipated no less from you!
<BR/>
<BR/>Kokoro: Wow... to think that you really did it...
<BR/>
<BR/>Satoru: And now, especially for you.... everyone, ready, and---!!
<BR/>
<BR/>All: Congratulations on having read 100% of the messages! Thank you for playing until the end!

<BR/><font size="+1">Notes</font>
<BR/>
<BR/><a name="LV1"><b>Lv1:</b></a>
<BR/>*1: Literally, "Stop", "rewind", "stop"... "playback". Possibly a reference to Ever17 (specifically Takeshi's System Voice). <a href="#LV1-1">↑</a>
<BR/>
<BR/>*2: The possible dangers Captain Yomogi cautions against are a succession of words which, in Japanese, sound (increasingly vaguely) like the word for "trap" (wana): nawa -> ana -> niwadori, and so on. <a href="#LV1-2">↑</a>
<BR/>
<BR/>*3: Yomogi says "samuraite" to Yuni here, which is not an actual word, but sets up a kanji pun - the character for "samurai", combined with "te" (侍て), looks almost the same as "matte" (待て, "wait"). <a href="#LV1-3">↑</a>
<BR/>
<BR/>*4: Yuni's name sounds VAGUELY similar to the Japanese pronounciation of this word. (Remember, Yomogi's profile in the Tips does say he loves stupid jokes...) <a href="#LV1-3">↑</a>
<BR/>
<BR/>*5: As far as we can tell, Yomogi's dialogue in this section was supposed to resemble various Japanese dialects, like the gibberish "foreign language" spoken by a TV comedian - think Borat. We decided to change them into Spanish instead. <a href="#LV1-4">↑</a>
<BR/>
<BR/>*6: The same gibberish as above, but meant to evoke the sound of a DJ scratching a record. <a href="#LV1-5">↑</a>
<BR/>
<BR/><a name="LV2"><b>Lv2:</b></a>
<BR/>*: "Rokugome": "The Sixth Station, Rokugome, is only slightly higher than Gogome. This reinforces the illusion that climbing Mt. Fuji is going to be easy." (<a href="http://tokyotombaker.wordpress.com/2010/07/11/casualties-of-mt-fuji/">http://tokyotombaker.wordpress.com/2010/07/11/casualties-of-mt-fuji/</a>) <a href="#LV2-1">↑</a>
