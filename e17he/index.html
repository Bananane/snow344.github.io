<center><h1>Ever17 Himmel Edition Patch v1.3</h1></center>

<h1>Known Issues</h1>
<ul>
<li>Entries in the <b>debug menu (eg. character status/flags)</b> might not update immediately. To fix this, enable the last debug entry (System status display).</li>
<li>Scene transitions, animations and text will appear faster than the unpatched version. This was done intentionally by raising the FPS cap from 30 to 45 to create a smoother experience. This means that text will sometimes finish before the voiced line, even if voice synchronization is on.
<li>Disabling skip mode sometimes results in characters coming out extremely slow (1 character per 3 seconds). This can be fixed by disabling voice synchronization.</li>
<li>Saving at a choice then re-loading and looking at the backlog sometimes causes the last line in the backlog to be glitched. Does not affect gameplay.</li>
<li>Some segments with Coco/Sara singing lag up the game. This exists in the original and doesn't usually cause a crash.</li>
<li>Return to title occasionally crashes. Data will still be saved, but you'll have to start the game again.</li>
<li>When returning to title/quitting, the following message appears momentarily: "save system memory". This is purely aesthetic.</li>
<li>Alt-tabbing out when the credits are playing and then bringing the game up again sometimes skips the credits.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to everyone that made this possible. We've easily logged hundreds of man-hours on this project, so we hope you enjoy it! Shoutout to everyone on the Rokumei City discord server for providing support.<br><br>

Special thanks to the original Ever17 translators, many of whom remain unidentified to this day. Special shoutout to Ryan Payton ("novery") who translated a chunk of the game and supposedly developed carpal tunnel due to the ridiculous deadlines. Yes, the translation was awkward at times, but it brought joy to thousands of people across the world. Thank you!</p>
